description: Spend a pleasant afternoon with Ruby Ayres' The Second Honeymoon, a lighthearted
  romance centered on a love triangle that's gone horribly awry. Jimmy Challoner is
  engaged to be married to Cynthia, an actress who is making a name for herself. Days
  before their wedding, Cynthia decides that Jimmy is not wealthy enough to deserve
  her hand. On the rebound, Jimmy jumps into a relationship with childhood pal Christine.
  Is ""happily ever after"" on the horizon?
